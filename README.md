##Usage (Professors)

###1. Run MoodMusic.py

###2. Testing the machine-learning

Choose option 'c' to use our test database since you don't have a database full of songs and it takes a long time to generate songs into the databse. You unfortunately will not be able to test option 'b', but we have a full video and screenshots.

###2. Testing the UI

Choose option 'a' and enter a file path or search for one to play the song. You can then add the song to a mood by using the menu.
