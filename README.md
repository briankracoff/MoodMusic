MoodMusic
=========

Playlist generator in Python


To run echonest.py, you must acquire an API key from EchoNest.

To use the key, create a file in the MoodMusic directory called myconfig.py and paste the following into the file, 
substituting your own API key where it says (insert_your_API_key_here):

mykey = "(insert_your_API_key_here)"
