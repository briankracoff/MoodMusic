This module will create a daemon in the background to get information on songs.
It will use the modules in input to get a list of files in the library and will
then run the data_mining function to get the sung attributes.

Here is a example of usage:

>>
import input.Import

# the constructor recieves the path to either Library.xml or the folder
# the second argument is the maximum number of files retrieved.
i = Import.Importer('/path/library/folder', 1000)

i.startDaemon() # this will start the process in background

# you can check to see if the process is alive or not with this.
# NOTE: the process might have been killed. this does not always mean the job is done
i.isAlive()

# you can join the background process with the foreground (the program will wait until
# the background is finished) using this
i.join()
