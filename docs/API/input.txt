Modules in the input package all provide a Import() method which will recieve a dict of params.
This was done to make the implementation of the import part in UI easier.
Currently we have:
    1. Filesystem : which reads files from filesystem
    2. iTunes: which reads the famous Library.xml

Import method will return:
	False on failure (path does not exist or its not readable)
	[] if no files were found
	[file, file, file] list of files that were found
	
WARNING: if you expect files but are getting any from the Filesystem module check the extensions.

Here a basic example of both:

>>
from Filesystem
from iTunes

i1 = Filesystem.Input(100) # the maximum items to read
files = i1.Import({"path":"some/path/to/files"})

i2 = iTunes.Input(200)
files = i2.Import({"xml_path":"path/to/Library.xml"})
