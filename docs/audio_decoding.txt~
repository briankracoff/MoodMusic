Findings about audio decoding in python:

Table of Contents:
  1. VLC
  

============== VLC
VLC has a python binding available at : http://wiki.videolan.org/PythonBinding

=== Requirments
VLC : Cross platform (most people have it / easy to install)

=== Description of features
I read the source file briefly and I didn't find anything that would return the decoded data from a file.
But it can be used to convert files to a temporary wav format (not good performance wise). Also a great thing
that can help us is that this module will let you create your own media player based on the functionality of
VLC, there are examples for GTK, QT and WX. check them out.

=== Things we can get from it
A nice GUI based on VLC for playing files. there are playlist and media source support in the code.
??? Decoding functionality for audio file - Not sure yet

in python.
